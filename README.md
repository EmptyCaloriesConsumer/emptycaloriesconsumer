# :wave: About me
An adult learner attending college with a passion for programming, design, and problem-solving. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, staying active through exercise, and working on small personal projects. I most commonly work with Java, JavaScript, and Python. I have a strong interest in both the technical and creative sides of development. I enjoy modern, minimalist designs. I'm always looking to learn more and improve my skills through hands-on building and collaboration.
